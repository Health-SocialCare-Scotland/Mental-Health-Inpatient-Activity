In this folder you can find the R code that was used to produce the Data explorer for PHSâ€™s publication on Mental Health Inpatient Activity.

The data explorer and the base files that were used to create it can be accessed via the following link (see the 'Data explorer' and 'Open Data and Data Files' sections): https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/mental-health-inpatient-activity/

To create the explorer, place all the base files from the 'Open Data and Data Files' section in your working directory, and then combine the three parts (data manipulation, server and ui, in that order) into a single R script and run it. Keep in mind that for the code to work, you will need to download and read in council area shapefiles for the map component (see instructions in data manipulation), and you will also need to write a glossary, to be placed in a subfolder in your working directory (see server). The glossary component of the code can be easily removed if it creates problems for you -simply comment out a) the server part that reads in the glossary and b) the 'Download glossary' buttons in the ui.
