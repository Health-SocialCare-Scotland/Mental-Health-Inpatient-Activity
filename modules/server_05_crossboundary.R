##* Cross-boundary flow server ----   

# There are three filters here: SELECT TREATMENT SPECIALTY, SELECT FINANCIAL...
# YEAR and SELECT HEALTH BOARD OF RESIDENCE.
# The reactive() command below creates a subset of the cross-boundary flow...
# dataset based on the user's selections in these three filters.
# This subset will then "feed" the cross-boundary flow chart.
# Additional transformations:
# Filter out NAs. We have quite a few NAs, as there are certain...
# combinations of values that don't make sense, e.g., State Hospital and...
# non-psychiatric specialties.
# In the measure column, we filter out 'Number of discharges', as we want the...
# cross-boundary flow diagram to show only number of patients.
# Moreover, we are only visualising inter-board flow, so we need to filter...
# out intra-board flow. To do this, we execute 'filter(flow == 0)'.
# Also, prevent R from visualising flows with zero patients.
# Rename the 'value' variable to 'Number of patients'.
# Finally, keep only the columns you need for the chart. This last step is...
# very important, as the Sankey diagram only works with three...
# variables: 1) origin, 2) destination, and 3) a numeric variable that flows...
# from origin to destination.
